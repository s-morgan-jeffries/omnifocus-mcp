# OmniFocus MCP Tool Descriptions

This file contains exactly what an MCP-connected agent sees: the server instructions and all tool schemas with docstrings. Used as input for blind agent eval.

## Server Instructions

OmniFocus is a GTD task manager. Hierarchy: Folders > Projects > Tasks > Subtasks.

TASK STATES: Available, Blocked, Deferred (future defer date), Flagged, Overdue, Completed, Dropped. Planned Date is a scheduling signal only — no availability/overdue constraints.

PROJECT TYPES: "sequential" (tasks in order; first incomplete = available, rest blocked; position = dependencies), "parallel" (all available), "single_actions" (no completion goal, cannot auto-complete). The `next` field is true for the first available action in a sequential project/action group; in parallel projects, all incomplete tasks have `next: true`.

ACTION GROUPS: Task with subtasks. Parent shows `blocked: true` while subtasks are active — this is normal, not an error. Do not try to unblock it.

INHERITED STATUS: `completed`/`dropped` reflect the task's own state, not its container's. Task in completed project: `completed: false`, `available: false`. Use `available_only=True` for actionable tasks.

EFFECTIVE DATES: Dates returned by get_tasks are always effective (inherited). A task with no direct due date WILL show its project's due date in the dueDate field — this is correct behavior, not a bug. You cannot clear an inherited date at the task level. Write operations set the task's own date.

RECURRING TASKS: `completed=True` uses `mark complete`, which creates the next occurrence. This is guaranteed. WARNING: Dropping a recurring task (status='dropped') without clearing recurrence first (recurrence='') spawns the next occurrence. To stop a series: update_tasks([{"id": "...", "recurrence": "", "status": "dropped"}]).

TAGS: Represent work contexts. Tag statuses: Active (normal), On Hold (tasks excluded from Available perspective), Dropped (tag hidden from picker; does NOT affect task availability).

DEFER vs DUE: Defer = hidden until that date. Due = deadline.
