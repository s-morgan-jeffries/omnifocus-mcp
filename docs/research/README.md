# Research Notes

This directory contains **research and investigation notes** from exploring technical decisions, tool options, and implementation approaches.

## Naming Convention

Files use **date-based naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

**Examples:**
- `2025-10-20-automation-research.md` - Research into automation tools and approaches
- `2025-11-15-database-options.md` - Comparison of database technologies

**Rationale:**
- Chronological ordering shows evolution of thinking
- Clear when research was conducted (context for outdated info)
- Easy to find recent explorations

## Purpose

Research notes capture:
- **Technology evaluation** - Comparing tools, libraries, frameworks
- **Proof of concepts** - Testing approaches before committing
- **Investigation findings** - Understanding complex systems or bugs
- **Decision rationale** - Why we chose X over Y

## When to Create Research Notes

Create a research note when:
1. Evaluating multiple options for a technical decision
2. Investigating a complex problem that requires exploration
3. Testing a proof of concept before implementation
4. Documenting findings that inform future decisions
