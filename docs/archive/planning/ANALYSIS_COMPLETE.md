# OmniFocus MCP Server: Complete Use Case Analysis - Summary

## Document Overview

This analysis consists of three interconnected documents:

1. **USE_CASES.md** (1,787 lines) - Comprehensive use cases with 10 personas and 15 detailed scenarios
2. **USE_CASES_SUMMARY.md** (321 lines) - Quick reference guide with priorities and gaps
3. **USE_CASES_ANALYSIS.md** (NEW) - Research synthesis, novel workflows, and implementation insights

## Key Findings

### The Core Insight
Users don't want AI to replace their judgment - they want it to eliminate the **"productivity tax"** of mechanical task management. Research shows knowledge workers lose:
- **23-45 minutes per context switch** recovering mental state
- **2-3 hours weekly** on GTD review processes
- **2-3 minutes per email** converting thoughts to structured tasks

**Total lost time: 5-10 hours per week** that AI could reclaim.

---

## Research-Backed Priorities

### What We Learned from Research

#### 1. GTD Methodology in Practice (2025)
- **Defer dates > Due dates**: Users favor "when can I start" over artificial deadlines
- **Tags evolved**: Multiple tags per task (location, energy, person, tool, priority)
- **Perspectives are power**: Advanced users build entire workflows around filtered views
- **Weekly review is sacred but painful**: Core GTD practice, but takes 2-3 hours

#### 2. Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Due date abuse**: Setting arbitrary deadlines leads to "due bombs"
- **Inbox neglect**: Processing is tedious, items pile up
- **Tag proliferation**: Too many tags, never used
- **Over-engineering**: Perfecting system instead of doing work

#### 3. What Users Try to Automate (via AppleScript)
Most common automation attempts:
1. Date manipulation (bulk defer/due date changes)
2. Template population with placeholders
3. Stalled project detection
4. Time estimation summation
5. Email-to-task parsing
6. Batch tag application
7. Waiting-for tracking

**AI Opportunity**: Do what scripts can't - understand intent, learn patterns, connect dots across tools.

#### 4. Modern AI Task Manager Lessons
**What works**: Automatic scheduling, smart deadlines, focus time protection, meeting impact analysis
**What fails**: Generic task lists (not GTD), forces tool abandonment, privacy concerns, feels "out of control"

**Our advantage**: Enhance existing OmniFocus, respect GTD principles, local-first processing.

## Key Implementation Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
**Simple by default, powerful when needed**
- Don't force users to specify everything
- Intelligent defaults with optional overrides
- Three levels: Simple, Intermediate, Advanced

### 2. Confirmation vs. Automation Balance
**Different automation levels for different stakes**
- Always automate: Inbox processing, suggestions, analysis
- Confirm before action: Creating tasks, setting deadlines, delegation
- Never automate: Deleting, completing tasks (unless requested), commitments

### 3. Context Awareness Hierarchy
**Know what to use when**
- Level 1 (Must): Explicit context from conversation
- Level 2 (Should): Recent activity, today's calendar
- Level 3 (Can): Historical patterns, completion history
- Level 4 (May): Predicted preferences, learned patterns
- Never Assume: Assignment, exact deadlines, priorities

### 4. Natural Language Date Support
**Support how users actually talk**
- Absolute: "October 15", "Next Tuesday", "Friday"
- Relative: "Tomorrow", "In 3 days", "End of month"
- Event-relative: "Before the client meeting", "Day before launch"
- Context-aware: "Friday" = this/next based on current day

### 5. Intelligent Defaults Strategy
**Learn from context**
- Task name inference: "call" → @calls tag
- Project urgency: Upcoming deadline → defer today
- Due dates: Only set if truly a deadline (avoid due bombs)
- Energy level: "plan" → @high-energy, "admin" → @low-energy
- Time estimation: Based on similar historical tasks

## Privacy & Trust Framework

### Privacy Principles
1. **Local-First Processing**: Data stays on user's machine when possible
2. **Explicit Consent**: Clear what data AI accesses
3. **Granular Control**: User can disable specific integrations
4. **Transparency**: Show what AI is doing and why
5. **No Surprise Sharing**: Never send data externally without asking

### Trust-Building Patterns
- Always explain why AI made a suggestion
- Show before doing (confirmation for significant actions)
- Make it easy to undo or adjust
- Never hide what AI is doing
- Respect user's final decision

### Data Handling
- **Never required**: Email access, calendar, external tools (all optional)
- **Local only**: Project analysis, statistics, pattern learning
- **Cloud optional**: Email parsing, transcription (offer local alternative)
- **User controlled**: Can delete all AI-generated data anytime
- **Encrypted**: All data at rest encrypted, API keys in keychain
