# Planning Phase Archive

This directory contains **planning documents from the v0.6.0 API redesign** (October 2025).

## Purpose

These documents guided the implementation of the major API redesign (40+ functions → 16 core tools).

**Status:** ✅ **Planning phase complete** - All proposals implemented in v0.6.0

**Why archived:**
- Original proposals have been implemented
- Actual implementation may differ slightly from plans
- Historical record of decision-making process
- Shows evolution from concept to reality

## Documents by Phase

### Pre-Redesign Analysis (October 7-8, 2025)

**ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md**
Executive summary of research phase. Identified need for API consolidation and MCP optimization.

**gap-analysis.md**
Early analysis identifying functionality gaps and inconsistencies in original API.

**implementation-roadmap.md**
Alternative roadmap structure (superseded by `../../project/ROADMAP.md`).

### API Redesign Planning (October 17-18, 2025)

**API_REDESIGN_PLAN.md** ⭐ **START HERE**
Complete redesign proposal with:
- Consolidation strategy (40 → 16 functions)
- Function mapping (old → new)
- Implementation plan with TDD approach
- Timeline and milestones

**Result:** ✅ Implemented in v0.6.0 (October 2025)

### Testing & Coverage (October 9, 2025)

**90_PERCENT_COVERAGE_PLAN.md**
Test coverage strategy, targets, and approach for maintaining high coverage during redesign.

**Result:** ✅ Achieved 89% coverage (target was 90%)

**INTEGRATION_TEST_COVERAGE.md**
Integration testing scope, real OmniFocus test approach, and edge case identification.

**Status:** Integration test suite operational

### Implementation Guide (October 7, 2025)

**QUICK_START_GUIDE.md**
Week-by-week guide for Phase 1-2 implementation. Provided structure for initial development.

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1-3 complete (all phases finished)

## Implementation Status

### What Was Planned
- Consolidate 40+ specialized functions
- Create 16 core CRUD functions
- Achieve 90% test coverage
- Follow TDD throughout
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### What Was Achieved
- ✅ 16 core functions implemented and operational
- ✅ 89% test coverage (close to 90% target)
- ✅ TDD approach followed
- ✅ Comprehensive integration tests
- ✅ Migration guide created

### Key Deviations
- Timeline: Faster than estimated (planning was conservative)
- Coverage: 89% vs 90% target (acceptable trade-off for faster delivery)
- No major architectural deviations from plan

## How Planning Documents Were Used

**During Implementation:**
1. `API_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` → Reference for function signatures and consolidation logic
2. `90_PERCENT_COVERAGE_PLAN.md` → Guide for test coverage targets
3. `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` → Weekly sprint planning

**Post-Implementation:**
- Historical reference for understanding design decisions
- Template for future major refactors
- Documentation of "why" certain choices were made

## Lessons Learned

**What Worked:**
- Comprehensive planning before implementation
- TDD approach caught issues early
- Integration tests caught AppleScript bugs unit tests missed
- Conservative timeline gave buffer for unexpected issues

**What Could Improve:**
- Some planning docs had overlapping content
- Earlier focus on integration test setup would help
- More examples of "before/after" API usage

## Current Documentation

For actual implemented API (not plans):
- **API Reference:** `../../reference/API_REFERENCE.md` (what exists now)
- **Architecture Principles:** `../../ARCHITECTURE.md` (why it's designed this way)
- **Migration Guide:** `../../migration/v0.6.md` (how to upgrade from v0.5.0)
- **Roadmap:** `../../project/ROADMAP.md` (current status and future work)

## When to Reference These

**Use planning docs when:**
- Understanding why a design decision was made
- Planning another major refactor (use as template)
- Explaining project history to new contributors
- Investigating why something was implemented a certain way

**Don't use planning docs for:**
- Current API usage (use `API_REFERENCE.md` instead)
- Understanding current architecture (use `ARCHITECTURE.md` instead)
- Learning how to contribute (use `guides/CONTRIBUTING.md` instead)
