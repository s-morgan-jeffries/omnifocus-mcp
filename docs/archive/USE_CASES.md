### USE CASE 11: Habit & Recurring Task Intelligence
**Personas:** Linda (Parent Professional), Sarah (GTD Purist), Taylor (Freelancer)

**Current State:**
Users set up recurring tasks manually, but inflexible scheduling often leads to guilt about "missed" tasks that weren't actually critical.

**Desired Workflow:**
1. AI learns user's actual completion patterns for recurring tasks
2. AI suggests flexible vs. strict scheduling
3. AI adapts frequency based on reality (claimed weekly but actually bi-weekly)
4. AI identifies abandoned habits and suggests archival
5. AI celebrates streaks and progress

**Example:**
```
Recurring Task: "Exercise" (set to daily, but completed 3x/week on average)

AI Analysis:
📊 Pattern Detected: You've completed "Exercise" 3x per week for 8 weeks
   Currently set to: Daily (leads to 4 "overdue" tasks per week)

💡 Suggestion: Change to "3x per week (flexible)"
   Benefits:
   - No guilt from "missed" days
   - Maintains your actual sustainable habit
   - Focus on weekly goal, not daily pressure

Accept change? [Yes/No]

---

Recurring Task: "Review expense reports" (set to weekly, not completed in 2 months)

AI Analysis:
⚠️ Abandoned Habit: Not completed in 8 weeks

Options:
1. Defer until needed (move to Someday/Maybe)
2. Delegate to team member
3. Delete (no longer relevant)
4. Keep but reduce frequency to monthly

What would you like to do?

---

### USE CASE 16: Project Cleanup & Reorganization Assistant
**Personas:** Sarah (GTD Purist), Dr. Chen (Academic), James (Non-Profit Director), and **The Overwhelmed Long-Time User**

**New Persona: The Overwhelmed Long-Time User (Morgan)**
**Profile:** Professional who's used OmniFocus for years (5-10+ years), accumulated 100+ projects
**OmniFocus Current State:**
- Many stalled projects (no recent activity, unclear next steps)
- Redundant or overlapping projects that should be consolidated
- Projects that should be split into multiple focused projects
- Mixed contexts and unclear organization
- Behind on reviews - some projects not reviewed in months/years
- Unclear which projects are still relevant vs. should be archived/dropped

**Pain Points:**
- Overwhelming to manually review 100+ projects
- Don't know where to start with cleanup
- Hard to identify patterns (which projects are truly stalled vs. just long-term?)
- Difficult to see relationships between projects (should these be merged?)
- Analysis paralysis: Every time I open OmniFocus, the mess prevents effective use
- Need guidance: "What should I do with this project?"

**Desired Workflow:**
1. User initiates systematic project review with AI
2. AI analyzes ALL projects with quantitative metrics:
   - Last activity date (task completion, modification)
   - Task count and completion rate
   - Number of available vs. blocked tasks
   - Review history (when last reviewed)
   - Time since project creation
3. AI categorizes projects into triage groups:
   - 🚨 **Critical attention** (has deadlines but no recent activity)
   - ⚠️ **Stalled but potentially active** (no recent tasks but not old)
   - 📦 **Archive candidates** (old, no activity, low completion)
   - ✅ **Healthy active** (recent activity, clear next actions)
   - 🔄 **Review needed** (not reviewed in >X weeks)
4. AI works through projects systematically, asking guided questions:
   - "This project hasn't had activity in 6 months. Is it still relevant?"
   - "You have 3 projects about home renovation. Should these be merged?"
   - "This project has 47 tasks. Should it be split into sub-projects?"
5. AI suggests specific actions:
   - Complete/archive project
   - Merge with another project
   - Split into multiple projects
   - Add clear next action
   - Move to different folder/context
   - Mark for review in X days
6. AI executes approved reorganization actions
7. AI generates "after" summary showing improvements

**Example Conversation:**
```
User: "Help me clean up my OmniFocus projects. I'm overwhelmed."

AI: I've analyzed your 147 projects. Here's what I found:

📊 Project Health Analysis:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Healthy (32 projects): Recent activity, clear next actions
⚠️ Needs Attention (68 projects): Various issues
📦 Archive Candidates (31 projects): No activity >6 months
🚨 Critical (16 projects): Has deadlines but stalled

Let's work through these systematically. I'll start with the most critical.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 CRITICAL #1: "Grant Application - Foundation XYZ"
Last activity: 4 months ago
Due date: 30 days from now
Status: 0 of 12 tasks completed
Created: 8 months ago

This has a deadline approaching but no recent work. Options:
A) It's still active - help me restart it
B) Deadline passed/no longer relevant - archive it
C) Need to defer - move deadline

Your choice? [A/B/C]

User: A - I need to finish this

AI: Great. I see the issue: no clear next action.

Looking at the tasks, you have:
- "Draft research methodology" (seems like the logical start)
- "Gather supporting documents"
- "Write budget justification"
- ... (9 more)

Should I:
1. Set "Draft research methodology" as the next action
2. Break this into phases (Research → Draft → Review → Submit)
3. Create a timeline working backward from the deadline

Recommend: Option 2 + 3. Want me to restructure this project?

User: Yes

AI: [Creates phases, sets defer dates, flags urgent items]

Done! "Grant Application - Foundation XYZ" is now organized into 4 phases
with next action: "Draft research methodology section 1" (due this week).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 CRITICAL #2: "Home Renovation Planning"
Also in:
- "House Projects" (folder: Personal > Home)
- "Kitchen Remodel" (folder: Personal > Home)
- "Bathroom Upgrade" (folder: Personal > Home)

These look related. Should I:
A) Merge all into single "Home Renovation" project
B) Keep separate but link them as sequential phases

**Current MCP Capabilities - Gap Analysis:**

✅ **What we CAN do:**
- Get list of all projects (`get_projects`)
- Get project metadata (name, note, folder, task counts, completion stats)
- Get project status (active, on hold, completed, dropped)
- Get tasks for a specific project (`get_tasks(project_id)`)
- Get task details (completion status, blocked status, available status)
- Update project properties (`update_project` - name, note, sequential)
- Update task properties (`update_task`)
- Delete projects and tasks
- Move tasks between projects (`move_task`)
- Create new projects (`create_project`)
- Add tasks to projects (`add_task`)
- Get stalled projects (`get_stalled_projects`)

❌ **What we CANNOT do (gaps for this use case):**
- **Get project last activity date** - No way to know when last task was completed/modified
- **Get project review history** - Can't see when project was last reviewed
- **Get project creation date** - Can't determine how old a project is
- **Define "stalled" parameters** - `get_stalled_projects` has hardcoded definition
- **Batch operations for reorganization:**
  - Can't merge projects (combine tasks from multiple into one)
  - Can't split projects (move subset of tasks to new project)
  - Can't archive/complete multiple projects at once
- **Task modification history** - Can't see when tasks were last changed
- **Flexible filtering** - Can't query "projects with no activity in last X months"
- **Get project tasks in one call** - Must call `get_project()` then `get_tasks(project_id)` separately

**Required Enhancements for This Use Case:**

**HIGH PRIORITY (blocking core workflow):**
1. **Project activity timestamps:**
   - Add `lastActivityDate` to project metadata
   - Add `lastReviewDate` to project metadata
   - Add `creationDate` to project metadata
   - Add `modificationDate` to project metadata

2. **Task modification timestamps:**
   - Add `completionDate` to completed tasks
   - Add `modificationDate` to task metadata
   - Add `creationDate` to task metadata

3. **Configurable stalled project detection:**
   - `get_stalled_projects(days_inactive=180, min_task_count=1)` - parameterize the definition
   - Return projects with no activity in X days

4. **Batch project management:**
   - `merge_projects(source_project_ids, target_project_id)` - combine multiple projects
   - `split_project(project_id, task_ids, new_project_name)` - move tasks to new project
   - `archive_projects(project_ids)` - mark multiple projects complete/dropped
   - `complete_projects(project_ids)` - bulk completion

5. **Enhanced project queries:**
   - `get_projects_by_activity(last_active_before="2024-04-01")` - filter by inactivity
   - `get_projects_by_review_status(not_reviewed_in_days=90)`
   - `get_projects_similar_to(project_id)` - find potentially duplicate/related projects

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (improves experience):**
6. **Project relationship detection:**
   - `suggest_projects_to_merge()` - AI analysis of similar names/contexts
   - `detect_project_overlaps()` - find projects with related tasks

7. **Reorganization previews:**
   - `preview_merge(project_ids)` - show what merged project would look like
   - Allow user to review before executing

8. **Progress tracking:**
   - Track reorganization session (how many reviewed, how many remaining)
   - Allow pause/resume of cleanup sessions

**LOW PRIORITY (nice-to-have):**
9. **Reorganization analytics:**
   - Before/after metrics (projects reduced from X to Y)
   - Health score improvements
   - Time estimates for remaining cleanup

**Priority:** SHOULD-HAVE
**Impact:** Very High - addresses major pain point for long-time users
**Effort:** High (requires new AppleScript properties, batch operations)
**User Segment:** Power users with mature OmniFocus databases (5+ years of use)

**Success Metrics:**
- Projects reviewed per session (target: 10-20 with AI vs. 2-3 manual)
- Time to review 100 projects (target: <2 hours with AI vs. 6-8 hours manual)
- Project count reduction (target: 20-30% archived/merged)
- Stalled project resolution rate (target: >80% get clear next action or archived)
- User confidence score post-cleanup (survey)

## User Research Recommendations

### Validation Studies Needed

1. **Time-to-Task Baseline**
   - Current: How long to process email → OmniFocus task?
   - Measure: Typing time + decision time + context switching
   - Target: Reduce by 80% with AI assistance

2. **Weekly Review Pain Points**
   - Survey current duration and frustrations
   - Identify which parts are most time-consuming
   - Validate AI assistance priority order

3. **Integration Priorities**
   - Which tools do users switch between most?
   - Where is most friction/duplication?
   - Which integrations would have highest impact?

4. **Natural Language Patterns**
   - How do users naturally describe tasks/projects?
   - Common ambiguities needing clarification
   - Preferred confirmation/verification style

5. **Trust & Control**
   - How much automation do users want?
   - Where do they want manual approval?
   - Privacy concerns with AI access

## Conclusion

An OmniFocus MCP server with AI capabilities has enormous potential to transform task management from a manual, reactive process into an intelligent, proactive system. The key opportunities are:

1. **Eliminate friction** between information sources (email, meetings, conversations) and structured tasks
2. **Reduce cognitive load** through intelligent suggestions and automation
3. **Prevent over-commitment** via capacity planning and realistic scheduling
4. **Maintain context** across frequent project switches
5. **Learn and adapt** to individual user patterns over time

The phased implementation approach ensures quick wins (email-to-task, meeting notes) while building toward more sophisticated capabilities (cross-tool integration, predictive analytics).

Success requires balancing automation with user control - AI should reduce drudgery while respecting user agency and the thoughtful aspects of GTD methodology.
