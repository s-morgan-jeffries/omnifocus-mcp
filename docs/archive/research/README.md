# Research Archive

This directory contains historical technical research documents from the OmniFocus MCP Server development process.

## Purpose

These documents were created during the **pre-v0.6.0 design and planning phases** (October 2025 and earlier). They are now **historical reference only** - the project has completed the major API redesign.

**Project context when these were written:**
- Before v0.6.0 (project had 40+ functions, now has 16)
- During evaluation of different implementation approaches
- Exploring features that were ultimately deemed out-of-scope

**They are preserved for:**
- Understanding why certain design decisions were made
- Historical context for architectural choices
- Reference if similar questions arise in the future
- Learning from the research process
