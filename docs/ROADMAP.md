# OmniFocus MCP Server: Development Roadmap

## Status: Phase 1 & 2 Complete ✅

**Note**: This roadmap has been revised. The original vision included email forwarding, calendar integration, and other application-layer features. However, these don't belong in an MCP server - they should be separate services or applications that *use* the MCP server.

**Phase 2 (Additional Primitives) is now COMPLETE**, bringing the server to **25 comprehensive MCP tools** covering all core OmniFocus functionality.

---

## Vision (Original)

Transform OmniFocus from a manual task manager into an intelligent AI-powered productivity system that bridges the gap between unstructured information (emails, meetings, conversations) and structured GTD workflows.

**Revised Vision**: Provide a clean, complete, well-tested MCP server that exposes all OmniFocus primitives to AI assistants like Claude.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation - COMPLETE ✅

### Goal
Enable basic AI-powered task management with proper OmniFocus structure

### Status: **COMPLETE**

All Phase 1 deliverables have been implemented and tested.

---

### Week 1-2: Enhanced Task API - ✅ COMPLETE

**What We Built:**
```python
# Full GTD support implemented
add_task(
    project_id="xyz",
    task_name="Call client about Q3 results",
    note="Discuss revenue targets and next steps",
    tags=["@calls", "@priority-high"],
    due_date="2025-10-15",
    defer_date="2025-10-14",
    flagged=True
)
```

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Updated omnifocus_client.py with full property support
- ✅ Extended AppleScript to handle tags, dates, flags
- ✅ Added validation and error handling
- ✅ Wrote comprehensive tests (79 unit tests for client)
- ✅ Documentation with examples

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All GTD task properties supported
- ✅ 100% AppleScript success rate
- ✅ <1 second task creation time

---

### Week 3-4: Task Query & Operations - ✅ COMPLETE

**What We Built:**
```python
# Get tasks with filtering
tasks = get_tasks(
    project_id="xyz",
    flagged_only=True,
    include_completed=False
)

# Task operations
update_task(task_id, due_date="2025-10-20", flagged=True)
complete_task(task_id)
```

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Implemented get_tasks with filtering
- ✅ Added update_task and complete_task
- ✅ Comprehensive filtering options
- ✅ Tests covering all query types (45 tests)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Support all common filtering patterns
- ✅ Accurate task status detection
- ✅ Fast query performance

---

### Week 5-6: Project Management - ✅ COMPLETE

**What We Built:**
```python
# Create new project
create_project(
    name="Acme Corp - Website Redesign",
    folder_path="Clients > Active",
    note="8-week timeline, Team: Sarah (design), Mike (dev)",
    sequential=False  # parallel project
)
```

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Implemented create_project
- ✅ Added get_project and search_projects
- ✅ Folder hierarchy management
- ✅ Tests and documentation (11 tests for create_project)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Create complex project structures
- ✅ Accurate folder path resolution
- ✅ Proper sequential/parallel project types

---

### Week 7-8: Email Integration MVP - ❌ OUT OF SCOPE

**Status**: Not implemented - doesn't belong in MCP server.

**Reasoning**: Email forwarding is application logic, not an MCP primitive. This should be:
- A separate service that calls the MCP server, OR
- Handled by Claude Desktop with the user forwarding emails to Claude manually

The MCP server provides the primitives (`add_task`, `create_inbox_task`, etc.) but shouldn't run email receivers or parsers.

---

## Phase 1 Success Metrics - ✅ ACHIEVED

**Technical:**
- ✅ All core tools implemented and tested
- ✅ <1 second response time for operations
- ✅ >95% API success rate (mocked tests)
- ✅ Zero data loss bugs
- ✅ 210 passing tests with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Multi-layer database safety system

**Architecture:**
- ✅ Migrated to FastMCP (38% code reduction)
- ✅ Clean decorator-based tool definitions
- ✅ Type-safe with auto-generated schemas
- ✅ Production-ready error handling

---

## Phase 2-4: Intelligence, Automation, Optimization - ⚠️ RECONSIDERED

**Status**: These phases mixed MCP primitives with application logic.

### What Belongs in MCP Server:
- ✅ **Already implemented** - All OmniFocus primitives complete

### What Doesn't Belong in MCP Server:
- ❌ Email processing
- ❌ Calendar integration
- ❌ Meeting transcription
- ❌ Analytics/dashboards
- ❌ Template systems (can be handled by prompts)
- ❌ GitHub/Jira integration (separate MCP servers)
- ❌ Time tracking (separate service)
- ❌ Voice interface
- ❌ Pattern learning

**These should be:**
1. **Separate services** that use the MCP server as a client
2. **Separate MCP servers** (e.g., calendar-mcp, github-mcp)
3. **Claude Desktop workflows** using the existing tools
4. **Prompt engineering** (templates, patterns)

---

## Phase 2: Additional Primitives - ✅ COMPLETE

### Goal
Expand MCP server to cover all essential OmniFocus primitives beyond the Phase 1 basics.

### Status: **COMPLETE** (v0.3.0)

All Phase 2 deliverables have been implemented and tested.

**What We Built:**
- ✅ Task deletion and management (delete, move, drop)
- ✅ Advanced task queries (available_only, overdue, tag filtering)
- ✅ Folder management (get, create)
- ✅ Task hierarchy (parent/child relationships)
- ✅ Project review system (GTD methodology)
- ✅ Time estimation
- ✅ Perspectives (OmniFocus Pro feature)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ 13 new primitives implemented in omnifocus_client.py
- ✅ Enhanced existing tools (get_tasks with advanced filtering)
- ✅ 64 additional tests (143 total client tests)
- ✅ 30 FastMCP server tests (0% → 73% coverage)
- ✅ Updated all documentation

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All tier 1 & 2 primitives covered
- ✅ 88% overall code coverage
- ✅ Production-ready test suite (302 passing tests)

---

## Phase 3: Refinement & Polish - 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### v0.5.0 (October 2025) - ✅ COMPLETE

**Focus:** Claude Desktop compatibility improvements and API refinements

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Added `update_project()` tool (name, note, sequential)
- ✅ Fixed `get_project()` to include `sequential` field
- ✅ Fixed Optional[bool] parameter validation issues
  - `update_task(flagged)` now accepts "true"/"false" strings
  - `update_project(sequential)` now accepts "true"/"false" strings
  - Workaround for FastMCP known issue with Optional[bool] parameters
- ✅ Added plain text note warnings to all note-related tools
  - Documented that OmniFocus automation APIs only support plain text
  - Warned that updating notes removes rich text formatting
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests
  - 5 integration tests for update_project
  - 8 unit tests for string boolean parameter handling
  - 1 integration test for flag toggling
- ✅ Migrated TDD practices from hooks to CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Added availability status fields (`available`, `numberOfAvailableTasks`)
  - Clarified why blocked tasks appear in Available filter

**Known Limitations:**
- ❌ Cannot retrieve formatted/rich text notes (OmniFocus API limitation)
  - AppleScript only exposes plain text
  - OmniAutomation has RTF access but cannot be called externally with result retrieval

**Current Tool Count:** 26 MCP tools (added `update_project`)

### Upcoming Work

**Planned:**
- ✅ Audit AppleScript interface for missing properties - **COMPLETE** (see `docs/APPLESCRIPT_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`)
  - ✅ **Found all needed timestamps!** creationDate, modificationDate, completionDate, droppedDate, lastReviewDate
  - 🚨 **Discovered**: Tags not exposed on task objects (have get_tags and add_tag, but can't see which tags a task has)
  - 📋 Ready to implement Phase 1 (timestamps + tags)

**High Priority - New Use Case Identified:**
- 🎯 **Project Cleanup & Reorganization Assistant** (USE CASE #16)
  - **User Need**: Long-time OmniFocus users (5-10+ years) with 100+ accumulated projects need systematic cleanup help
  - **Workflow**: AI-guided review, categorization, and reorganization of stale/redundant projects
  - **See**: `docs/USE_CASES.md` for detailed analysis
  - **Key Missing Features**:
    - Project/task activity timestamps (lastActivityDate, creationDate, modificationDate)
    - Configurable stalled project detection (parameterize definition)
    - Batch operations (merge_projects, split_project, archive_projects)
    - Enhanced project queries (filter by inactivity, review status)
  - **Impact**: Very High for power users with mature databases
  - **Effort**: High (requires new AppleScript properties, batch operations)

**Under Consideration:**
- Batch operations for improved performance (some already implemented: complete_tasks, move_tasks, etc.)
- Additional filtering options based on user feedback
- **Note management improvements** (open design question):
  - Should we add dedicated `set_note()` function (or `update_note()`) for explicit note-only updates?
  - Single function for both tasks and projects: `set_note(item_id, note, item_type="task")`?
  - Should note parameter remain in `update_task()` and `update_project()` for convenience?
  - Alternative: `append_note()` for non-destructive incremental updates?
  - **Rationale**: Updating notes is destructive (removes formatting), should be more intentional
  - **User workflow**: Generate Markdown notes in Claude, copy/paste into OmniFocus manually

## Next Steps

For the MCP server:
1. ✅ Test with Claude Desktop
2. ✅ Documentation updates
3. ⏳ Complete property audit
4. ⏭️ Additional enhancements based on usage patterns

For application-layer features:
1. Build separate services that use this MCP server
2. Or use Claude Desktop with this server + manual workflows
3. Or create separate MCP servers for other systems (calendar, email, etc.)

---

## Open Questions (Resolved)

1. **Pricing Model:** Free, open source MCP server
2. **OmniGroup Relationship:** Independent tool
3. **Data Privacy:** Local-only, no cloud processing
4. **Platform Support:** macOS only (OmniFocus limitation)
5. **Multi-user:** Individual-focused (as OmniFocus is)
