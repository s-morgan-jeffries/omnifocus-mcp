# Mistake Tracking Infrastructure Roadmap

**Purpose:** Track development of the recursive self-improvement system for OmniFocus MCP Server.

**Current Status:** 75-80% functional, 85-90% closed feedback loop (Fourth analysis: 2025-10-19)

- [x] Added git hooks for automated validation
- [x] Established mistake categories and severities

### Phase 2: Prevention Automation (Oct 18-19, 2025)

- [x] check_test_count_sync.sh - Prevents MISTAKE-002
- [x] update_metrics.sh - Prevents MISTAKE-004 recurrence
- [x] check_recurrence.sh - Detects if prevention failed

### Phase 3: Validation Sprint (Oct 19, 2025)
- [x] Second gap analysis - Found 14 gaps
- [x] Third analysis (brutal honesty) - Found metrics broken, claims inflated
- [x] Fourth analysis (verification) - Confirmed fixes working

## Current Phase: Gap Resolution (Oct 19-26, 2025)

### Priority 1: Fix Monthly Metrics ❌
**Status:** Not started
**Deadline:** 2025-10-26
**Effort:** 1 hour

**Problem:** METRICS.md monthly table shows all zeros despite 6 mistakes in October 2025

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add monthly parsing to update_metrics.sh
- [ ] Populate METRICS.md monthly table with actual counts
- [ ] Fix malformed table header ("2" → proper column names)
- [ ] Verify data matches manual count

**Blocks:** Trend analysis, pattern detection effectiveness

---

### Priority 2: Test CI/CD in Practice ⚠️
**Status:** Not started
**Deadline:** 2025-10-26
**Effort:** 30 minutes

**Problem:** Workflow file exists and looks correct, but never tested in GitHub Actions

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Push branch to GitHub (if not already)
- [ ] Create PR with intentional version mismatch
- [ ] Verify workflow runs and fails
- [ ] Fix mismatch and verify workflow passes
- [ ] Document enforcement is validated

**Blocks:** Enforcement validation claim

---

### Priority 3: Add TDD/Architecture Detection ⚠️
**Status:** Not started
**Deadline:** 2025-11-02
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Problem:** Pre-commit hook detects 4/6 categories (67% coverage). Missing violated-tdd and violated-architecture.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] TDD detection: Check if test file modified AFTER implementation (git log timestamps)
- [ ] Architecture detection: Scan for anti-patterns (set_X functions, specialized getters)
- [ ] Add to pre-commit hook
- [ ] Test positive and negative cases
- [ ] Update prevention tests

**Blocks:** 100% detection coverage

---

### Priority 4: Update Honest Assessment ⚠️
**Status:** Not started
**Deadline:** 2025-10-20
**Effort:** 15 minutes

**Problem:** Percentage claims still slightly inflated (optimism bias)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update third analysis response doc
- [ ] Change "80-85% functional" → "75-80%"
- [ ] Change "90-95% closed loop" → "85-90%"
- [ ] Acknowledge fourth analysis finding

**Blocks:** Honest measurement claim

---

## Upcoming Phase: Effectiveness Verification (Nov 18, 2025)

**Trigger:** 30-day observation period complete (2025-10-19 → 2025-11-18)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Check if any prevented mistakes recurred
- [ ] Run `./scripts/check_recurrence.sh` for final assessment
- [ ] Update effectiveness scores from "pending" to "effective ✅" or "ineffective ❌"
- [ ] Identify patterns (4 missing-docs mistakes → threshold met!)
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md based on learnings
- [ ] Fifth agent analysis (if patterns detected)

**Goal:** Data-driven effectiveness assessment, not assumptions

---

## Future Phases

### Phase 5: Pattern Analysis (After Nov 18, 2025)
**Trigger:** 3+ mistakes in same category (we have 4 missing-docs!)

**Planned:**
- Root cause analysis of missing-docs pattern
- CLAUDE.md updates to prevent category
- Detection expansion (currently 4/6 categories)
- Consider automation improvements

### Phase 6: Long-Term Measurement (Q1 2026)
**Trigger:** 90-day observation (Feb 2026)

**Planned:**
- Calculate actual recurrence rates
- Measure which prevention measures work best
- Assess if detection bias reduced
- Quarterly agent analysis

### Phase 7: Detection Expansion (When needed)
**Planned:**
- Increase detection coverage beyond 67%
- Automate violated-tdd detection
- Automate violated-architecture detection
- Add missing-exposure automated checks

## Success Criteria

**System is considered "effective" when:**

1. ✅ **Template works** - Easy to log mistakes
2. ✅ **Prevention works** - No recurrences detected
3. ✅ **Validation works** - Tests prove prevention effective
4. ⏳ **Measurement works** - Accurate metrics (monthly data broken)
5. ⏳ **Enforcement works** - CI/CD blocks violations (untested)
6. ⏳ **Detection comprehensive** - 100% category coverage (currently 67%)
7. ⏳ **Effectiveness proven** - 30-day observation (pending 2025-11-18)
8. ❌ **Patterns improve CLAUDE.md** - Haven't analyzed 4 missing-docs yet

**Overall:** 75-80% functional, 85-90% closed loop (as of Oct 19, 2025)

## Questions & Decisions

### Should we automate agent analyses?
**Decision:** No. Quarterly human-prompted analysis is better than automated weekly reports.
**Rationale:**
- Resource cost (agent runs expensive)
- Diminishing returns (after 4 analyses, gaps are minor)
- Alert fatigue (automated reports get ignored)
- Context matters (human knows when deep review needed)

**Instead:** Automate reminders (deadline checks), not analyses.

### How often should we run analyses?
**Schedule:**
- Quarterly (every 3 months)
- After major milestones (verification deadline, pattern threshold)
- When recurrence detected (prevention failure)
- Not on arbitrary calendar dates

### How do we ensure gaps get fixed?
**Solution:** ANALYSIS_GAPS.md with deadlines + check_monitoring_deadlines.sh

### Is this a separate project?
**Decision:** No. Treat like test infrastructure.
**Philosophy:**
- Essential for quality ✅
- Versioned with project ✅
- Not on feature roadmap ✅
- Has own documentation ✅
